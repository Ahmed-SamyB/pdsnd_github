### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data.

### Description
This project explores data related to bikeshare systems for three major cities in the US: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. It creates an interactive experience where it takes raw input from the user to present statistics.
This is a CLI program developed to allow the user to explore an US bikeshare system database and retrieve statistics information from the database. The user is able filter the information by city, month and weekday, in order to visualize statistics information related to a specific subset of data.

This program is structured in 2 steps.
In a first moment, the user selects the filters that are going to be applied to the database. The user is able to choose as many filters as it would like.
After this step, the DataFrame for the analysis is created based on the filters chosen by the user.
In a second moment, the user is able to choose from a list of options,the statistics the user would like to calculate, based on the available filtered data.
As of December 2019 the user is now able to choose to view raw data and also able sort this data by columns, in ascending or descending order.



### Files used
There are three CSV files that were used for this project: chicago, new_york_city, and washington. These files contain statistical data about the bike share system for the three mentioned cities.

### Credits
Data in the three files mentioned above (chicago, new_york_city, and washington) is provided by "Motivate", which is a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States.
